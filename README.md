## ⭐ STAR Breakdown

### ✅ **Situation**
With the increasing volume of online transactions, businesses rely heavily on data analytics to improve operations and customer satisfaction. This project simulates an E-commerce company that wants to understand customer distribution, order patterns, delivery efficiency, and cancellation behavior using SQL-based insights.

### 🧾 **Task**
Build a realistic relational database with customer, order, product, and seller data and perform a wide range of SQL queries to answer business questions. The goal is to apply core SQL skills such as joins, aggregation, filtering, and grouping in a real-world structure.

### ⚙️ **Action**
- Created a synthetic dataset of 10,000 orders using Python and Faker.
- Designed a normalized relational schema with five tables:
  - `customers`, `orders`, `products`, `sellers`, and `geolocation`.
- Built the schema and constraints using MySQL Workbench.
- Created an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram for structural clarity.
- Wrote and executed SQL queries at increasing difficulty levels:
  - 4 Easy: basic filters and counts
  - 3 Medium: aggregations, averages, and date formatting
  - 3 Hard: advanced joins, CASE statements, and logic-based filtering

### 📈 **Result**
- Developed 10 industry-style SQL queries covering customer behavior, delivery performance, cancellation trends, and product engagement.
- Demonstrated clear understanding of relational databases and query optimization.
- Gained hands-on experience with SQL that aligns with real-world data analyst responsibilities.

# E-Commerce Sales Analysis using SQL

This project simulates an e-commerce sales environment with 10,000 synthetic records. It includes customers, orders, products, sellers, and geolocation data, all analyzed using SQL queries.

## Schema Design (ER Model)

customers (customer_id) ───< orders (customer_id)
products  (product_id)  ───< orders (product_id)
sellers   (zip_code)    ───
customers (zip_code)    ─┬──> geolocation (zip_code)
sellers   (zip_code)    ─┘

## SQL Query Topics

### Easy
- Customers by State
- Order Status Count
- Unique Products Sold
- Products by Category

### Medium
- Top States by Customers
- Average Delivery Time
- Monthly Order Count

### Hard
- Top Ordering Customer
- Cancellation Rate by Category
- On-Time vs Delayed Orders

## Tools Used

- Python (Faker) for data generation  
- MySQL Workbench for creating schema and running queries  
- SQL for querying and analysis  
- CSV and PDF formats for outputs

## Files Included

- customers.csv  
- orders.csv  
- products.csv
